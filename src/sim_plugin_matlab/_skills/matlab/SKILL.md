description: Use when running MATLAB `.m` scripts or Simulink `.slx` / `.mdl` models through sim-cli's MATLAB plugin — one-shot via `uv run sim run --solver matlab`, local persistent sessions via `uv run sim connect --solver matlab`, explicit JSON result extraction, and conservative handling of MATLAB desktop and Simulink model state. Shared / remote Simulink sessions are a non-goal.

# matlab-sim

You are driving **MATLAB** via the sim MATLAB plugin. This skill is
self-contained for MATLAB-specific work: it covers one-shot batch runs,
local persistent sessions, Simulink dispatch, version probing, acceptance, and
escalation points for this plugin.

Start every real task with:

```bash
uv run sim check matlab
```

For one-shot execution, use `uv run sim run --solver matlab <script-or-model>`. For a
local persistent MATLAB engine session, use `uv run sim connect --solver matlab`, then
bounded `uv run sim exec` snippets, then `uv run sim disconnect`. Persistent sessions require
the optional `matlabengine` package that matches the installed MATLAB release;
use `uv run sim env install matlab` or install the matching pin from
`compatibility.yaml`.

Other optional MATLAB and Simulink agent toolkits may be available in the
active agent environment. Combine them with this plugin when they fit the local
setup and task. Examples include MathWorks' MATLAB Agentic Toolkit, Simulink
Agentic Toolkit, and MATLAB MCP Core Server tools such as
`evaluate_matlab_code`, `run_matlab_file`, `check_matlab_code`,
`detect_matlab_toolboxes`, `model_overview`, `model_read`, `model_edit`,
`model_query_params`, `model_resolve_params`, and `model_test`.

Do not install, configure, vendor, or assume external agent toolkits from
inside this plugin. If those tools are present, agents and users can combine
them directly with `sim`; if they are absent, `uv run sim run`, `uv run sim exec`, and MATLAB
`-batch` remain valid paths.

## MATLAB-specific layered content

`uv run sim inspect session.versions` (run against a short-lived session
before your real `uv run sim run`) returns:

```json
"session.versions": {
  "profile":             "matlabengine_24_1",  // or 24.2 / 23.2
  "active_sdk_layer":    "24.1",                // matlabengine package version
  "active_solver_layer": null                   // engine version IS the release pin
}
```

`active_sdk_layer` is the matlabengine package version. There is no
separate `solver/` overlay because each matlabengine X.Y is rigidly
coupled to one MATLAB release (24.1 ↔ R2024a, 24.2 ↔ R2024b, …).

Always read `base/`, then your active `sdk/<slug>/`.

### `base/` — always relevant

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `base/reference/` | MATLAB-specific control patterns: how to pass numpy arrays to engine, how to read engine.workspace, how to surface MATLAB errors as Python exceptions. |
| `base/snippets/` | Ready-made `uv run sim run` payloads for common analyses. |
| `base/workflows/` | End-to-end multi-script examples. |
| `base/driver_upgrade.md` | Process notes for bumping the matlabengine SDK pin. |

### `sdk/<active_sdk_layer>/` — engine-version specifics

Empty stubs by default; per-engine deltas land here as discovered.

- `sdk/24.2/notes.md` — matlabengine 24.2 / R2024b
- `sdk/24.1/notes.md` — matlabengine 24.1 / R2024a
- `sdk/23.2/notes.md` — matlabengine 23.2 / R2023b

### Documentation lookup

Primary route for every MATLAB doc question is **MATLAB's own `help()`
/ `doc` via the engine**. This plugin does not bundle a documentation scanner;
on R2024+ MathWorks ships most reference docs as a Lucene binary index, not
static HTML.

#### Primary: `help()` / `doc` via the engine

From a live sim session:

```bash
uv run sim exec "disp(help('fft'))"
uv run sim exec "disp(help('ode45'))"
uv run sim exec "disp(help('fmincon'))"        # Optimization Toolbox
uv run sim exec "disp(help('solve'))"          # Symbolic Math Toolbox
```

Without a session (and without paying matlabengine startup cost), use
the MATLAB launcher directly:

```bash
matlab -batch "disp(help('fft'))"
```

This is authoritative — it reflects the toolboxes actually loaded,
respects shadowing, and handles overloaded methods correctly. Works
identically across all MATLAB releases. Verified end-to-end against
R2025b: returns structured syntax + arguments + examples + see-also.

For a longer write-up (the `doc` command's content), use
`uv run sim exec "open(which('fft'));"` only when a desktop is available;
otherwise query the online docs at `https://www.mathworks.com/help/`.

#### Fallback: local docs and online docs

**Known limitation:** on MATLAB R2024a and later, the per-toolbox
folders under `<matlabroot>/help/` (`optim/`, `simulink/`, `stats/`,
`signal/`, `control/`, `symbolic/`, …) contain **no HTML reference
pages** — only Lucene binary indexes (`.cfs`/`.cfe`/`.si`) that the
regex scanner can't read. The `matlab/` folder does have ~500 HTML
files, but they're Code Analyzer diagnostics, not function refs.

What the scanner still catches on modern installs:
- `derived/toolbox/learning/…` — Simulink tutorial / learning content.
- Pockets of HTML under `customdoc/`, `coder/`, and a few other dirs.
- The core MATLAB help on **R2023b and earlier** (full static HTML).

If you need longer prose than `help()` gives, use MATLAB's `doc` command when a
desktop is available, or query `https://www.mathworks.com/help/`. For function
and API questions on R2024+, go straight to `help()`.

### `tests/` (top-level, QA-only)

Not loaded during a normal session.

## Simulink

The MATLAB driver dispatches on input suffix. `.slx` and `.mdl` models
route through a package helper shipped with this plugin at
`src/sim_plugin_matlab/matlab_pkg/+sim_shim/run.m`, not through the
generic `matlab -batch run('<script>')` wrapper used for `.m` files.
The driver adds the `matlab_pkg/` parent to the MATLAB path, opens the
model with `load_system`, registers an `onCleanup` that calls
`close_system(<name>, 0)`, calls `sim_shim.run(<name>, '{}', <out_dir>)`,
and parses the final JSON line from stdout. `sim_shim.run` runs `sim()`,
tries to flatten the `Simulink.SimulationOutput` to a `timetable`, and
writes either `<out_dir>/<model>_out.parquet` (preferred) or
`<out_dir>/<model>_out.mat` (fallback), then emits a single line of the
form `{"ok":true,"result_file":"<path>","format":"parquet|mat","signals":[...]}`.
`out_dir` defaults to `<script_parent>/.sim/<model_name>/`. The
`uv run sim check matlab` probe additionally surfaces `simulink: installed |
not found on disk` per install, driven by a filesystem check for
`<matlabroot>/toolbox/simulink/simulink/`. Full contract in
[`base/reference/simulink.md`](base/reference/simulink.md).

What is **not** wired yet (deferred per [sim-cli issue
#27](https://github.com/svd-ai-lab/sim-cli/issues/27)): the rest of the
`+sim_shim/` package helpers beyond `run` (Phase B — `models`,
`blocks`, `signals`, `set`, and `sweep` / `parsim` parameter sweeps);
`models.summary` / `blocks.summary` / `signals.summary` /
`figures.summary` inspect verbs (Phase C); a typed `SimulationResult`
/ `SweepResult` dataclass wrapping the pointer JSON (Phase D); sample
`.slx` regression fixtures in sim-datasets (Phase F); and shared /
persistent Simulink sessions (listed under Non-goals in issue #27).
Today you get one `uv run sim run <model.slx>` per simulation and read the
result file yourself; do not assume any of the deferred surface exists.

## MATLAB-specific hard constraints

These add to — do not replace — the shared skill's hard constraints.

1. **MATLAB output is not structured by default.** Always wrap the
   final result in an explicit JSON line on stdout that the driver's
   `parse_output()` can pick up. Free-form `disp()` output gets lost —
   the parser only picks up the **last** JSON object in stdout.
2. **Don't depend on workspace survival across calls.** v0 is
   one-shot per script; the driver tears the engine down between
   `uv run sim run` invocations. Do not write snippets whose correctness
   depends on workspace state set by an earlier `uv run sim run`.
3. **No MATLAB desktop.** Driver launches headless. Do not add
   `desktop` / `-desktop` flags — there is no display.

---

## Required protocol (one paragraph)

Follow the shared skill's required protocol for the **one-shot batch**
model. MATLAB-specific steps: validate the `.m` script exists and its
dependencies (data files, toolboxes) are on the MATLAB path; confirm
the final script line emits a structured JSON object on stdout; run
`uv run sim run <script.m> --solver matlab`; parse the JSON line from stdout
(the driver does this via `parse_output()`) and evaluate against the
user's acceptance criterion per the shared skill's `acceptance.md`.
For multi-step pipelines, chain `uv run sim run` calls — each is its own
engine lifecycle with no shared state.
